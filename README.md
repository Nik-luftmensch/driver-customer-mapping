# driver-customer-mapping
Explore the power of H3 geospatial indexing in a practical application for mapping drivers and customers dynamically. Inspired by real-world logistics solutions like Uber, this project utilizes H3's hexagonal grid system to efficiently match customers with the nearest drivers based on both H3 indexing and geodesic distance calculations.
